abstract: |
    This paper presents a new approach for user guided-colorization of line arts in computer vision. The
    current state of the art uses GANs to generate realistic and precise colorization, but relies on randomly
    sampled pixels as color hints for training. This approach aims to improve upon this by introducing a stroke
    simulation based approach for hint generation, making the model more robust to messy inputs. We also propose
    a new cleaner dataset, and explore the use of a double generator GAN to improve visual fidelity.
