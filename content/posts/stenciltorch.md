abstract: |
    This paper presents StencilTorch, a new approach to the task of automatic lineart colorization in
    computer vision. It is an interactive and user-guided framework that generates illustrations from
    a given lineart, color hints, and a mask, allowing for iterative workflows where the output of the
    first pass becomes the input of a second. This approach improves upon previous methods in both
    objective and subjective evaluations.
