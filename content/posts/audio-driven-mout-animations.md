abstract: |
    This paper proposes a new neural architecture for text-driven 3D mouth animations for personal assistants
    to improve the realism and naturalness of the interactions. The study shows that such visual feedback
    improves users comfort for 78% of the candidates significantly while slightly improving their time perception.
